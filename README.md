# Sales-Analysis
Performed an in-depth analysis of randomly generated sales dataset that closely resembles real world dataset. The tasks utilized advance Exploratory Data Analysis techinques to provide solutions to 5 strategic business enquiries. The insights discovered were visualized in canvas form using Streamlit App. See link below.


The 5 strategic business questions addressed were:

* What was the best month for sales and how much was earned?
* What city sold the most product?
* What time is best for advertisement to maximize the likelihoods of buying these products?
* What products are most often sold together?
* What product sold the most and why?

A look at the questions shows that these tasks are quite interesting and match the standard of most Data Science interview questions.
